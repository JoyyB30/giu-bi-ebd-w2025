## 2. Project Description

FarmConnect is a FinTech solution designed to digitize the financial activities of small farmers in Egypt
The app acts as a bridge between the farmer, their suppliers, and the bank, helping farmers:
•	Record sales
•	Record purchases from suppliers
•	Get automatic daily/monthly totals
•	Request micro-loans using their national ID
All activity is stored in the backend and becomes a digital financial history that the bank can access to evaluate the farmer’s creditworthiness.
This solves the core problem:
Farmers have no digital records → banks cannot trust or evaluate them → farmers cannot access loans.
FarmConnect replaces paper, guesswork, and middlemen with a clean digital profile.
